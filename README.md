# mouseMazeAI
This project was part of the CSCI 1133 course at the Unviersity of Mnnesota Twin-Cities.

Programming Languages used: **Python (+ Turtle library)**

This Project was about designing a self-modifying AI that would allow the "Mouse" to get to the "cheese" (objective).

This is done through a points system (added points for positive actions like getting closer, not backtracking...)
after N tries, the algorithm generates a newer generation with a chance of mutating them (changing one of heir oves)
The program continues until one mouse has reached

### Running the Simulation

This project can be run by executing the **ga.py** file

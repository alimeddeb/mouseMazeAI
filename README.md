# mouseMazeAI
This project was part of the CSCI 1133 course at the Unviersity of Mnnesota Twin-Cities.

Programming Languages used: Python
This Project was about designing a self-modifying AI that would allow the "Mouse" to get to the "cheese" (objective).
This is done through a points system (added points for positive actions like getting closer, not backtracking...)
after N tries, the algorithm generates a newer generation with a chance of mutating them (changing one of heir oves)
The program continues until one mouse has reached
